-- Next steps --
1. REBOOT THE SERVER! Some configurations changes are not applied yet.
2. Start the database and the domserver with NO judgehosts --> ./start.sh 0
3. Get the default admin password for domjudge from the logs --> ./viewlogs.sh
4. Login in Domjudge and go to the Users section, edit the Judgehost user and set its password to the previously generated one. You can retrieve the passwords from the file passwords.txt, remove as soon as secured somewhere else.
5. Change the admin user password.
6. Launch as many judgehosts as you want with ./start N, but note that any judgehost that cannot be automatically assigned to a core will die, so make sure you have enough cores.
Judgehosts should register automatically and appear in the corresponding section.
7. Stop the services at any time executing ./stop.sh.
